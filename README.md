# Developer Profile

Welcome! I'm a passionate and versatile game developer with a strong foundation in system architecture, AI design, and interactive world-building. I specialize in building complex, rule-driven systems that support emergent gameplay and responsive AI behaviors. My long-term goal is to create truly living open-world games as an independent developer.

## 🛠 Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
- **C#** – Primary language for Unity development
- **Python** – Tooling, automation, and backend scripting
- **C/C++** – Systems programming and performance-critical modules
- **Rust** – High-performance, memory-safe systems development
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** – Web tooling and frontend logic

### Game Development
- **Unity Engine** – Full-stack experience in both 2D and 3D projects
- **Behavior Trees & Finite State Machines** – For modular AI systems
- **Procedural Generation** – Tools and systems for terrain, missions, and AI logic
- **Custom Tooling** – Editor extensions, debug UI, and workflow optimization

### AI & Simulation
- **AI Behavior Design** – Decision trees, rule-based systems, emergent NPC logic
- **Open-world System Architecture** – Time systems, event queues, entity state machines
- **Simulation Layers** – Combat, life cycles, organization systems, and more

### System Architecture
- **Modular System Design** – Separation of concerns, dependency injection, event systems
- **Data-Driven Design** – YAML/JSON configurations, dynamic rule engines
- **Save Systems** – Seamless background saving and restoration for complex stateful worlds

## 🔧 Tools & Frameworks

- **Unity Editor / URP**
- **Visual Studio / VSCode**
- **Git / GitHub / Git LFS**
- **Docker / Syncthing / Cloudflare Zero Trust**
- **OpenAI / LLM API Integration**

## 🌍 Philosophy & Vision

I believe great systems are:
- **Intuitive in behavior**, yet **deep in interaction**
- **Rule-bound, not script-bound**
- **Built for emergence**, not mere execution

My current focus is the development of a **fully interactive, rule-based open-world game**, where every NPC has purpose, every system interacts, and the player is just another force in the living world.
